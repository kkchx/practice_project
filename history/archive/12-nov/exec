Install the packaging tool you prefer. For PyInstaller, you can use pip install pyinstaller,
and for cx_Freeze, use pip install cx_Freeze.

Create a Python script for your Tkinter application. Make sure it's a standalone script
that includes the necessary import statements and defines your GUI.

Open your command line or terminal and navigate to the directory where your script is located.

Use the packaging tool to create an executable. For PyInstaller,
you can run pyinstaller --onefile your_script.py.
For cx_Freeze, you'll need to create a setup script to specify the options,
and then run cxfreeze your_script.py.

After the packaging process is complete, you'll find the executable file in a "dist" or "build" directory.
