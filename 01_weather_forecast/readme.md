   5. Asks user if he wants to check another city or exit a program (use a loop)
2. Create a proper documentation in readme1.md
3. Do self code-review and wait for Collaborator to review before merging to Main/Master Branch
4. Remember, we're creating a show-case, so use best practices from all previous projects
   
## as an example, use a code from previous projects
change the logic to use functions to guarantee:
