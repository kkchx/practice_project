## File Remover By Extension
This Python script allows you to delete files in a specified directory based on their file extensions.


## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Operating System: Windows, Linux, macOS


## Example
Suppose you want to delete all .txt files from a directory called `example_dir`. Here's how you would use the script:<br>
- Enter the directory from which to delete files: example_dir<br>
- Enter the file extensions to delete (separated by commas, eg., jpg, txt, doc): txt


### Notes
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to delete files in the specified directory.<br>
- Exercise caution while using this script, as deleted files cannot be recovered.
